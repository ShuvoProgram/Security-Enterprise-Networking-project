# Security Enterprise Network Design

---

## üöÄ Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Design a secure enterprise network architecture.
- Demonstrate communication between systems using routing and switching protocols.
- Implement and test security measures, including firewalls, VLANs, ACLs, and VPNs.
- Provide a scalable and redundant network for enterprise applications.

## üñ•Ô∏è Devices Used

- **Routers:** Cisco ISR Series (e.g., ISR 2911) for routing and inter-network communication.
- **Switches:** Cisco Catalyst Series (e.g., Catalyst 2960) for VLAN and inter-VLAN routing.
- **Firewalls:** Simulated firewall devices for network perimeter security.
- **Servers:**
  - Authentication Server (e.g., AAA Server).
  - DNS Server.
  - Application Servers (Web and Database).
- **End Devices:** PCs, laptops, and wireless devices connected through VLANs.

## üì° System Communication

### Communication Protocols:
- **Routing Protocols:** OSPF/EIGRP for efficient network routing.
- **Switching:** VLANs (802.1Q) for logical traffic segmentation.
- **Security Measures:**
  - ACLs for traffic filtering.
  - Firewalls for access control.
  - VPNs for secure remote communication.

## üîß Configuration

### Key Configurations:
1. **Routers:**
   - OSPF/EIGRP configuration for dynamic routing.
   - NAT for external access.
   - VPN tunnels for secure remote access.
2. **Switches:**
   - VLAN configurations for segmentation.
   - Trunking for inter-VLAN communication.
3. **Firewalls:**
   - Rule-based access control for inbound/outbound traffic.
   - Stateful packet inspection.
4. **Servers:**
   - DNS configuration for name resolution.
   - Authentication services (e.g., RADIUS).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Install Cisco Packet Tracer:**
   - Download from [Cisco NetAcad](https://www.netacad.com/).
2. **Open Project File:**
   - Clone this repository and load the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. **Inspect and Configure:**
   - Open the devices in Packet Tracer to review the topology.
   - Apply any necessary configurations (VLANs, routing, firewalls, etc.).
4. **Simulate:**
   - Use simulation mode to test connectivity and verify security policies.
5. **Document Results:**
   - Record test results and analyze the network's performance.

## üåÄ Workflow

1. **Planning:**
   - Define the network's objectives, such as scalability, redundancy, and security.
   - Design the topology and device roles.
2. **Implementation:**
   - Configure VLANs, routing, firewalls, and servers.
   - Set up remote access through VPNs.
3. **Testing:**
   - Simulate traffic and validate network configurations.
   - Verify ACLs, routing protocols, and connectivity.
4. **Optimization:**
   - Troubleshoot any issues and fine-tune configurations.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain detailed records of configurations, addressing schemes, and test results.
